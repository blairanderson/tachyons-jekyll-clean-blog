Forever free, open source. [Tachyons Templates](#) is a collection of free to download Tachyons themes and templates. Our themes are open source and you can use them personally or commercially.

# I think of Tachyons as an API for CSS styling.

Unlike bootstrap which has specific named classes for components, Tachyons uses atomic definitions that are combined to create those same components.

So instead of
`div.list-group-links-with-borders`

you would use something like

`div.list.link.borders`

This is cool because your styles change but your stylesheets don't have to change as often.

If you wanted to add [padding](http://tachyons.io/docs/layout/spacing/) to a single list:

`div.pa2`

using one of `pa1, pa2, pa3, pa4, pa5, pa6, pa7`

The idea is to write as little CSS as possible, so if you define a class for each property and common value then you'll never have to write them again.
